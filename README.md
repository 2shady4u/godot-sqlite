# godot-sqlite

This GDNative script aims to serve as a custom wrapper that makes SQLite3 available in Godot 3.1+. Additionally, it 
does not require any additional compilation or mucking about with build scripts.

This is the orphaned 'assetlib'-branch that serves as a disconnected branch from which the Godot Asset Library downloads
its files. For the branch containing the complete documentation, as well as instructions on how to contribute, please see:
